Dr Tim Johnson, from Curtin's School of Earth and Planetary 
Sciences, said the idea that the continents originally 
formed at sites of giant meteorite impacts had been around 
for decades, but until now there was little solid evidence 
to support the theory.

"By examining tiny crystals of the mineral zircon in rocks 
from the Pilbara Craton in Western Australia, which 
represents Earth's best-preserved remnant of ancient crust, 
we found evidence of these giant meteorite impacts," 
Dr Johnson said.

"Studying the composition of oxygen isotopes in these 
zircon crystals revealed a 'top-down' process starting with 
the melting of rocks near the surface and progressing deeper, 
consistent with the geological effect of giant meteorite 
impacts.

"Our research provides the first solid evidence that the 
processes that ultimately formed the continents began with 
giant meteorite impacts, similar to those responsible for 
the extinction of the dinosaurs, but which occurred 
billions of years earlier."

Dr Johnson said understanding the formation and ongoing 
evolution of the Earth's continents was crucial given 
that these landmasses host the majority of Earth's biomass, 
all humans and almost all of the planet's important mineral 
deposits.

"Not least, the continents host critical metals such as 
lithium, tin and nickel, commodities that are essential 
to the emerging green technologies needed to fulfil our 
obligation to mitigate climate change," Dr Johnson said.

"These mineral deposits are the end result of a process 
known as crustal differentiation, which began with the 
formation of the earliest landmasses, of which the Pilbara 
Craton is just one of many.

"Data related to other areas of ancient continental 
crust on Earth appears to show patterns similar to those 
recognised in Western Australia. We would like to test 
our findings on these ancient rocks to see if, as we 
suspect, our model is more widely applicable."
